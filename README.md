# Bikesharing

# Overview
There is still some more work to be done to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal! In order to solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders is requesting to see a bike trip analysis. For this analysis, I use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders, show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Lasly, I add the new visualizations to the two I previously created in this # 14 moduled for the final presentation 

## Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format

#### Checkout Times for Users Viz

#### Checkout Times by Gender Viz

#### Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Viz

#### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) Viz

#### User Trips by Gender by Weekday Viz
